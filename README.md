# Snooker-O

This is a Scala/Play framework project inspired by a mix of an Orienteering Score event and the rules of Snooker.  

The aim of the project is to import the basic results file of a Score event from SiTiming's software and 
process them according to our simplified Snooker rules to calculate each competitors score.

## How to use the application

1. Run a normal Score event using SiTiming.  There is no need to allocate points to controls, they will be ignored anyway.
2. Export the results from SiTiming.  Use the export processable CSV option.
3. Run this application and set up your control numbers for each colour.
4. Import the SiTiming results file.
