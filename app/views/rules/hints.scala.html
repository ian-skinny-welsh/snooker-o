@(punchCount: Int)(implicit request: MessagesRequestHeader)

  <h1>Hints</h1>
  <p>Unless your memory is good we recommend taking a pen and marking off the Reds on your map as you collect them to avoid repeat punches
    or missing any of them out.</p>
  @if(punchCount > 0){
    <p>The minimum number of punches needed to clear all the balls correctly will be @punchCount. The hire dibbers have a maximum capacity of 32 punches.
      You can therefore make one or two mispunches only or risk running out of punch capacity on your card before completion- Plan your strategy
      and punch carefully â€“ GOOD LUCK!</p>
